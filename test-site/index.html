    <p>James Bond doesn't drive a toyota. But, if you drop 60 pounds, don a black leather jacket with white japanese lettering, black leather pants, 
        sport sunglasses, and hop into a mk1 Toyota mr2, you won't any longer mind british sensibilities. The light chassis sporting a lovely short wheel base
        and such touchy handling (snap oversteer) should evoke anything but images of a great british car. 
        For them, there's nothing quite like a 4 meter long chassis, with a bleeding umbrella in the door pocket.
    </p>
    <p>All of that is beside the point. The toyota mr2 is one of japans first real attempts at a sport car. It comes (broadly speaking) in three iterations</p>
    <o1>
        <li>1983-1989 mk1 mr2 (later years come with a factory turbo charger and rwd)</li>
        <li>1990-1997 mk2 mr2</li>
        <li>1997-2004 mk3 mr2</li>
    </o1>
    <p>And stylistically, you can hardly tell they're related (save the mid-engine design).</p>
